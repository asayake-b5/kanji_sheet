* Credits
This project is made possible majoritarily thanks to the great work by the [[https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/index.html][KanjiVG Team (Â© 2009-2012 Ulrich Apel)]], who graciously lend their SVG data under the [[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/][Creative Commons BY-SA License]] and made this project possible.

One small change was made to make these SVGs compatible with the rust library [[https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg][=resvg=]] (by removing the namespaced content, using a =sed= one liner). The modified files are provided under the same license as per the terms of the CC BY-SA license.
